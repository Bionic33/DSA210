DATASET
My daily use of my mobile phone will be the dataset, in combination with my sleep duration and quality. I will collect the data for 2 weeks.
IDEA
Does my screen time have any correlation with the quality and amount of sleep I get each night, and are there any patterns, or any specific apps?
PLAN
I will note down the amount of sleep I get each night, and assign a quality point out of 10. At the same time, my screen time, and which apps were used the most, will also be logged down. At the end of the 14 day period, starting this Monday of 02/12/2024, I will have a correspondonce table of sleep/screen time habits, which I can use to make inferences regarding any effect of screen on my sleep
