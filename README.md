DATASET
My daily use of my mobile phone will be the dataset, in combination with my sleep duration. I will collect the data for 2 weeks.
IDEA
Does my screen time have any correlation with the quality and amount of sleep I get each night, and are there any patterns.
PLAN
I will note down the amount of sleep I get each night. At the same time, my screen time will be logged down. At the end of the 14 day period, starting this Monday of 02/12/2024, I will have a correspondonce table of sleep/screen time habits, which I can use to make inferences regarding any effect of screen on my sleep.
